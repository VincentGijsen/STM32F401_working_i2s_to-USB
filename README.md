# STM32F401 I2S source to USB audio

repo: https://github.com/VincentGijsen/STM32F401_working_i2s_to-USB

This is semi-working working code to read I2S (48khz), and offer that to the USB-host in form of a soundcard.

## TODO's
* fix the buffer mechanism to get rid of artifacts and slave the USB to the I2S Source (external)


## Versions:

* Works only with specific version of the STM4-HAL drivers. 
* Latest STM-HAL(1.28)
